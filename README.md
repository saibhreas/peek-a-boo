## Purpose: 

This is a build for a course **React Front To Back**
from the course description 

     In this course you will learn to master React 16.8+ concepts including how to create a Flux pattern using the Context API with the useContext and useReducer hooks. We will also build a full stack MERN application with a custom Express backend API that uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. In addition, we will also create a project that uses Redux.
